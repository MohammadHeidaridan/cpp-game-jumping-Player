# cpp-game-jumping-Player
Hi, This my first game and first project in c++(this is a text based game)

use left and right arrow key to move left and right
and use space key on keyboard to jump

game logic : you can jump and get scores
absolutely you can add life(heart) and thorn(something like ^ or <) concepts!

in this project you can see "Abstraction" and "Encapsulation" concepts of oop 

in Platform class you can add sun or a cloud or a bird  or a grazing
and for sun and movement of its rays you can use Animation class(that's the concept of Abstraction)

or you can create a game like "no internet connection" of chrome that player be fixed and only jumps!

or you can create a game like mario! the code is ready!
